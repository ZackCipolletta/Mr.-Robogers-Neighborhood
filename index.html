          It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, <br>
          A beautiful day for a neighbor, <br>
          Would you be mine? <br>
          Could you be mine? <br>
          <br>
          It's a neighborly day in this beautywood, <br>
          A neighborly day for a beauty, <br>
          Would you be mine? <br>
          Could you be mine? <br>
          
          I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you, <br>
          I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you. <br>
          
          So let's make the most of this beautiful day, <br>
          Since we're together, we might as well say, <br>
          Would you be mine? <br>
          Could you be mine? <br>
          Won't you be my neighbor? <br>
           <br>
          Won't you please, <br>
          Won't you please, <br>
          Please won't you be my neighbor? <br>
           <br>
          Hi television neighbor, I'm glad we're together again....
